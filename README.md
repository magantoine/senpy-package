## Usage

You can send notifications from a script to your app using `notify_me`
```python
from senpy import notify_me

notify_me("Great job")
```

You can track your jobs using the `ntm` `with` statement:

```python
from senpy import ntm
from time import sleep 

with ntm(range(10)) as iterator:
        for i, item in enumerate(iterator):
            sleep(5)
``` 


## To contribute

### Architecture 

The directory ```senpy_package``` is, for now built as follows :
```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€senpy # Folder containing the source code
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€manage.py # Django management script
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€senpy # Project setup
    â””â”€â”€â”€
â”œâ”€â”€â”€tests
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€manage.py # Django management script
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€senpy # Project setup
    â””â”€â”€â”€
â””â”€â”€â”€setup.py # Package configuration file
```


### Development

To get started, you can create a virtual environnement and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
```
git clone https://github.com/magantoine/senpy-package
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd senpy-package
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following command from the top folder:
```
pip install --editable .
```
You only need to run this command once. What it does is that it installs a package, called `senpy`, whose implementation is in the current folder (and not in the usual `site-packages`), so every subsequent code modifications while be taken into account.
You can directly go to the Usage section.
